NVIMUX
======

This plugin is a very simple set of keybindings that try to mimic tmux on neovim.

Currently, there are no customisation and no fancy settings. I plan to have those anywhere in the future though.

Feel free to use!

Also, I'll be very glad if you could open a PR helping enhance this.

TODO
----

There are some things I wish to do:

-[ ] Allow alternate tmux prefix
-[ ] Enable alternate commands to commands (i.e. `<C-b>c` could open a terminal on a new tab)
-[ ] Add more tmux bindings
-[ ] Allow toggling mappings for terminal mode
